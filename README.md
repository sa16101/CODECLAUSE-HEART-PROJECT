Heart Disease Risk Assessment (Golden Project)
🎯 Aim

Date: 31 January 2026
To design and develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input health metrics and to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the risk of heart disease.

📖 Description

The Heart Disease Risk Assessment project focuses on creating a healthcare application that helps in predicting the likelihood of heart disease. Users can enter their health-related information such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate through an interactive UI.

The system uses a Machine Learning classification model (such as Random Forest) to analyze the input data and determine whether the person is at risk of heart disease. This project highlights the importance of early diagnosis and preventive healthcare using data-driven techniques.

🧠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

UI Framework: Flask / Streamlit

Machine Learning Library: Scikit-learn

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
